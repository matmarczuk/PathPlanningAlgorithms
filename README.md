# PathPlanningAlgorithms
The aim of this repo is to present most common path planning algorithms, with the specialization of Autonomous Cars on ROS platform.


Algorithms are presented as ROS packages with nodes inside. Every package is different approach to the topic. If there is two or more nodes in package, it means that there are few types of algorithm.
